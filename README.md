# Alchemykit - A powerful MCP Server Providing Tools for Coding Agents (Experimental)

My intent is to create a simple and powerful MCP server that provides tools for
coding agents. Coding agents are AI systems that can write code, and there are
some things that they struggle with, for instance data conversion. Alchemykit
aims to provide a set of tools that can be used by coding agents to perform
various tasks such as data conversion in a simple and efficient way.
